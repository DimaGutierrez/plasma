# Patterns

Referring to recurring or ever-present elements or practices throughout a product. A few examples include navigation, cards, empty or loading states, notifications, and modals. Documenting a pattern library helps us to identify these elements in an effort to establish and maintain consistency in our product's structure, user experience and design.

Patterns are built using the system [components](/components/README.md) and [foundations](/foundations/README.md).

## Work in-progress

We are working on documentation for our Plasma pattern library, and will update this documentation when its ready.
