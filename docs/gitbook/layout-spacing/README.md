# Layout & spacing

Some things to note:

* For the most part the spacing between elements is consistently one of the following values: `5px`, `10px`, `15px`, `20px`, `30px`, or `40px`.
* Layout wise, the margin between elements is mostly `30px`.
* Patterns and components (e.g. segmented card and modal) mostly have an outer/container `40px` padding to give the content more breathing room and extra focus.
* See the section on [form elements](/form-elements/README.md) for their unique spacing rules.
* See the section on [buttons](/buttons/README.md) for their unique spacing rules.

Below is a general guide to spacing for a couple generic layouts.

The guidelines above are directed at general layout of a template. Please see the documentation for each pattern and component for their unique spacing.
