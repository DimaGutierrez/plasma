# Tooltips

Tooltips can be attached to any element. When you hover the element with your mouse, the title attribute is displayed in a little box next to the element, just like a native tooltip, only it can be styled as below. Tooltips are useful for things like form elements and tables, to show additional or helpful information.

Note: All CSS shown is for guiding purposes, it's not absolute. It's intended to help designers foster a greater understanding of both CSS and the specifications.
