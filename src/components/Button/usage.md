### Guidelines
- Buttons contained in narrow spaces (e.g. filters) should fill 100% of the width available to them. This helps with cleaner alignment with other elements in that column, and also aligns multiple buttons when stacked.
- If multiple buttons are horizontally aligned, there should be a 20px margin separating them.
- If multiple buttons are stacked vertically, there should be a 10px margin separating them.
- Icons can be used in link style buttons, where applicable.
- No icons on primary, secondary or tertiary style buttons.
